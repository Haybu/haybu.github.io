    <p>Spring framework provides a comprehensive and extensible support for authentication
and authorization. Latest enhancements in Spring 5.x have made it simple
to apply security standards such as OAuth2 to secure applications. In this blog I will
demonstrate how to use OAuth2 second-generation support in Spring framework to
secure a distributed microservices application.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<hr />

<p>A simple “Flight Agency” demo application will be used in this
blog to illustrate using the latest Spring 5.x security features of OAuth2 to
support microservices authentication and authorization. The architecture of the
distributed demo application consists of a front-end web application and a couple
of backend microservices. All modules of the application are implemented using
Spring Boot to take advantage of the auto-configuration and opinionated features.</p>

<p>As illustrated in the diagram below, the system consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Front-end Web application implemented using Tymeleaf. The application allows
a user to search for a flight from an origin to a destination within
certain dates, select and book the itinerary flights (called agency-web).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A back-end service to retrieve available itinerary flights (called flights-service).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A back-end service to perform reservations and book the itinerary (called reservations-service)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the application demo uses common services implemented with Spring
cloud (Spring Boot based), such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A configuration server to externalize and centralize microservices’ configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A registration and discovery service using Spring Cloud Eureka implementation to
help service to register and discover each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Spring Cloud Gateway, as an edge proxy in front of the two backend services
of flights and reservations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="running-the-application">Running the application</h2>
<hr />

<p>Before you run the application you need to register a client in one of the OAuth2
/ OpenId Connect providers. Okta can be chosen as a provider for this demo. You can
create a free developer account if you do not have one already by going to okta
developer’s [portal] (https://developer.okta.com/). Once logged into okta, register
a new application with authorization_code grant, identify a name and specify the following
parameters in the registration form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Login redirect URIs: <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code></li>
  <li>Initiate Login URI: <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8080</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Note down the client ID and client secret provided after you complete the registration.</p>

<p>Register another application but this time with client_credentials grant, specify
a name in the registration form and note the provided client ID and client secret.</p>

<ul>
  <li>clone the application from github</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/Haybu/RA-OAuth2-Gen2.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Change your working directory to go to “RA-OAuth2-Gen2/config-files” folder, edit
agency-web.yml file and enter the client_id and client secret of the application
registered in okta with authorization_client grant type. Also enter your okta’s
account URL on “spring.security.oauth2.provider.okta.*” properties to replace the
host name portions as appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the same folder, edit reservations-service.yml file and enter the client ID
and client secret of the application registered in okta with client_credentials
grant type. Also make sure to supply appropriate URL per your Okta’s account on
the security provider’s parameters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change your working directory back to “RA-OAuth2-Gen2” and run the startup.sh
script file to compile, package and run all application’s modules</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>./startup.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="application-flow">Application Flow</h2>
<hr />

<p>After bringing all modules up, access the web client application by going to
http://localhost:8080. You will be directed to your OAuth2 provider’s (in this
case Okta) to authenticate and authorize to the application. Once successfully
logged in, search for a trip intinerary by entering: origin as <strong>AUS</strong>, destination
as <strong>IAH</strong>, departure date as <strong>5/5/2018</strong> and return date as <strong>5/22/2018</strong>.</p>

<p>The application will display a list of flights, select your outgoing flight. On
the next page pick your returning flight, then click on “book” on the following
page and you will be presented with two confirmation numbers for each flight.</p>

<p>As illustrated in the sequence diagram below, the client application
utilizes a backend “flights service” to provides all available flights per
a search request. Additionally, a “reservations service” is also helping the
client application to perform booking on the selected flights. The client application
and both backend services are implemented using Spring Boot. They all leverage
Spring Cloud configuration server to externalize their configurations, and Spring
Cloud Eureka for services registrations and discoveries. The front-end client
application talks to the backend services via a Spring Cloud Gateway.</p>

<h2 id="spring-configuration-server">Spring Configuration Server</h2>
<hr />

<p>While you can choose from many supported backend to host application configurations,
in this demo a local native file system storage is used to keep all application’s
“yml” property files. The configuration files repository, illustrated below, contains
all “yml” files each named after its application name.</p>

<p><img src="../images/spring-oauth2-gen2/config-files.png" width="200" height="120" title="architecture" /></p>

<p>Applications bootstrap their configurations by pointing to the configuration
server URL as identified in each application’s ./resources/bootstrap.yml file.</p>

<h2 id="services-registration-and-discovery">Services Registration and discovery</h2>
<hr />

<p>Client application, two backing API services and the gateway application<br />
register themselves automatically with a Spring Cloud Eureka server when they
spin up. When the client application wants to interact with one of the backend
services it uses a “WebClient” bean that is set with a “LoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction”
filter to help with balancing out of the discovered target services’ instances.</p>

<p>For example, a client application would define a load-balanced “WebClient” bean
as listed below and use that to interact with underneath services discovered
from a Eureka service. Further configuration to the “WebCliet” bean will be
defined further below to help authenticating and access the registered backend
services.</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">@Bean</span>
 <span class="n">WebClient</span> <span class="nf">webClient</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">LoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction</span> <span class="n">eff</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

 <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="spring-cloud-gateway">Spring Cloud Gateway</h2>
<hr />

<p>As mentioned above, the web client application communicates with the two backend
micorservices via a Spring Cloud Gateway. The Gateway is configured also in its
“yml” configuration file in the configuration server with all the routes qualified
by a target path to each proxied service. And As shown below, a “RewritePath” filter
is defined to observe the context path of each target service.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">spring</span><span class="pi">:</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="oauth2-security">OAuth2 Security</h2>
<hr />

<p>In this architecture we need to apply OAuth2 security to the client application
and the two backend microservices. New security enhancement in spring 5.x paves
an easy way to secure applications using OAuth2 standards.</p>

<h3 id="1-web-application---oauth2-client">1. Web Application - OAuth2 Client</h3>

<p>You can take advantage
of auto-configuring an OAuth2/Open ID connect clients if you have
“spring-security-oauth2-client” dependency on your classpath. It is even gets
simpler to register as many clients as you desire using properties with
“spring.security.oauth2.client” prefix, and define your provider’s properties with
“spring.security.oauth2.provider” prefix.</p>

<p>For instance, in this demo, after the web client application is registered with
one of the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect providers (like Okta), you can configure the
web application with properties that register a client with the a client-id and
client-secret. Also you can define the selected client’s provider with information
such as the authorization URI, token URI, user-info URI and JWK set URI. With those
providers who support OpenID Connect discovery, the configuration could be further
simplified by specifying the issuer URI (with “spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.
oidc-provider.issuer-uri” prefix).</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The configuration listed above shows many properties for clarity. However, its worth
to note, the framework provides a set of default configured common OAuth2 and
OpenID providers, such as Okta, Google, Facebook, and Github. So the configuration
for Okta above could be simplified as below. Notice, the registered client named
as ‘okta’ same as the provider name.</p>
